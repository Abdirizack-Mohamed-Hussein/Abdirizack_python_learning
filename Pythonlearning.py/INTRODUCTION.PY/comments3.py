#comments start with a # and python will render the rest of the line as a comment.
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment.

#A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent python from executing code!
#print("Hello, World!") 
print("Cheers, World!") 


#MULTILINE COMMENTS!
#PYTHON DOES NOT REALLY HAVE A SYNTAX FOR MULTILINE COMMENTS.
#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line.
#This is a comment.
#witten in
#more than just one line
print("Cheers, HABIBA!")


# or
#you can use a multiline string.
#Since python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code but then ignore it and you have made a multiline comment!
'''This  is a comment witten more than just one line'''
print("Cheers, ABDIRIZACK!")
#NB; As long as the string is not assigned to a variable , python will ignore it!
